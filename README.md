"# DemandForecasting" 

**Use Case**:
A small business owner needs to forecast sales and optimize inventory for several reasons. Firstly, it helps with budgeting and financial planning by providing insights into revenue streams and resource allocation. Secondly, it ensures efficient inventory management, balancing stock levels to meet customer demand without overstocking or understocking. This, in turn, enhances customer satisfaction by ensuring products are available when needed. Moreover, it improves operational efficiency, prepares for seasonal trends, strengthens supplier relationships, and mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations or disruptions

Through this project we intend to analyse the sales data by SKU of a business across different stores or companies to predict the sales for future time frame. Based on the predicted data, we will arrive at the proected demand. Based on the projected demand, we will give the user the re-order point for an SKU. 

**Reorder Point**: The reorder stock metric is crucial for businesses as it helps to optimize inventory levels, preventing stockouts and reducing holding costs. By tracking when stock needs to be replenished, businesses can avoid stockouts that can lead to lost sales or overstocking that ties up capital and storage space unnecessarily.

**Safety Stock**: Safety stock, also known as buffer stock or reserve inventory, is the extra inventory held by a business above its typical demand levels to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in demand, supply chain delays, or other unforeseen factors. It serves as a buffer to ensure that there are enough products on hand to meet customer demand even during periods of increased demand or unexpected disruptions.
